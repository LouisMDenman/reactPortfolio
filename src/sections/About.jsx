                <p> Graduating high school, I wanted to make a change in the world and help as many people as I could, and thought that I would have the best chance at doing so by becoming a doctor and practicing medicine. As a result, I chose to study the Bachelor of Science & Information Technology at the University of Queensland with a Major in Biomedical Science. This served as an appropriate undergraduate degree to pursue medicine, but over the first two years of study I realised that Information Technology was my passion, and I could make a greater impact in this field. With this decision made, I studied the Bachelor of Information Technology for the next two years whilst juggling a career at Boral Concrete, where I experienced some of my greatest career achievements to date, including managing the distribution of concrete resources to some of the largest projects in SEQ (Cross-River-Rail, Star Casino, Coomera Connector), and being flown to Perth, WA to train a completely new set of call center staff for the region in two weeks. Whilst I learnt an incredible amount from the experience, I knew it was not a long term career I wanted to pursue, and with some further research concluded that software engineering and web development was the space I wanted to be in. As a result, I enrolled in the Coder Academy Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, and will be an emerging graduate engineer in 2025.
